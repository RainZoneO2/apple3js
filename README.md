# apple3js

**apple3js** is an immersive 3D gallery web experience built with Three.js. It allows you to showcase images in a dynamic and interactive 3D environment.

## Installation

To get started with apple3js, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the project to your desired location:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RainZoneO2/apple3js.git

## Usage

Follow these three steps:

1. **Add Your Images** <a name="add-your-images"></a>  
   Place your desired images into the `static/memories/textures/to-process` directory. These images will be used as textures in the 3D gallery.


2. **Build locally**  
   To see the local build of your 3D gallery, run:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   If you did [Step 1](#add-your-images) correctly, then you should see some output regarding image processing in the console.

3. **Preview the Local Build**
